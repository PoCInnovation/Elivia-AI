### How it's work ?
With a android app and the help of the [Vosk](https://alphacephei.com/vosk/android) lib to translate your speech to text.
To detect the intention and understande what you want we use RASA as NLU and Spacy as NLP. After this we extract all the entities (like the personne you want to call).
With all of this we take action !
